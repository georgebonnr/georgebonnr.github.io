        <h1>Product</h1>
        
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h3>I set the floor, the team sets the ceiling</h3> 
        <p>
            With strong product sense and attention to detail, a good PM can ensure that their team ships a product that meets users' needs. 
            However, a great PM knows that it takes an informed and motivated team to for an idea to realize its full potential. <br /><br /> I believe that clearly 
            defining the product process and inviting others to participate in it is the most reliable way to deliver a quality user experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Robust discovery</h3>  
        <p>
            I believe in defining separate tooling and expectations for discovery and delivery, and encouraging teams to be fluent in both. I've found that if a team 
            understands how to de-risk through prototyping as well as how to deliver stable production code (and when they are expected to do each), much of the pain 
            involved in properly balancing speed and technical debt disappears.
        </p>
        <h3>Curiosity and resilience</h3>
        <p>
            In the early stages of an idea, I like to ask "What would prove me wrong?" and then try to get quick answers to those questions. 
            After a product is delivered I can't wait to separate the wins from the misses and debrief on both. <br /> <br />Staying curious about when and 
            why we are wrong quickly reveals the full extent of the challenges the business faces. Resilience views those challenges as an exciting opportunity for growth.
