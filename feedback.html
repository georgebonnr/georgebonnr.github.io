        <p class="quote">"I have a lot of respect for the attention to detail, strategic focus, and thoughtful communication with which [George] collaborates as the product owner of a project. The thing I am most impressed by, however, is how he shows up a leader: he knows how to build trust with teammates, gives consistent honest and kind feedback, positive or negative, stays receptive to the same, and actively works on building a team environment where everyone wants to do their best work."</p>

        <p class="quote">"George's work synthesizing data, research, input from internal stakeholders, and the competitive landscape set the bar for the team on rigorous, detail-oriented, thoughtful product thinking. As evidenced in his peer feedback, George's product thinking and execution raises the bar on the team."</p>
        
        <p class="quote">"In taking on pricing, George took on the kind of work that consulting firms filled with MBAs tackle. And he did a superb job, leveraging his curiosity to explore all facets of the problem. Starting with first principles, doing broad analysis, then pulling it back into a clear recommendation and defense of his proposal, he was able to place Patreon in the context of the competitive landscape and creator expectations in a way to [drive] alignment on a future direction."</p>

        <p class="quote">"It's pretty amazing to see where merch has come from in just a year's time, and so much of that is due to George's leadership. His kickoffs and documentation continue to be exceptional, and really set the team up for success. ... George is always thoughtful in how he thinks about problems and risks, and he can see edge cases and challenges that I miss. I consider him one of the best partners for product thinking that I've had the chance to work with because in addition to being a strategic thinker, he’s creative, empathetic, and nice."</p>

        <p class="quote">"George was able to push the team from an incremental approach ... to adding all additional regions in one go. He got the buy in necessary from Ops and Engineering ... in addition to ensuring the technical discovery ... was in place. The impact was growth in usage ... and the impact of this work is still seen in product adoption today."</p>
        
        <p class="quote">"Merch for all was delivered ahead of schedule, which was impressive considering the huge eng and design lift .... George also worked closely with design on the usability ... and the product looks great. Merch for All has unlocked significant growth for merch."</p>

        <p class="quote">"George’s Merch dashboard work was brilliant."</p>

        <p class="quote">"George has impressed me with his quarterly prioritization exercises as he has thought deeply about impact, effort, and risk management."</p>

        <p class="quote">"There probably isn't anyone else in this company who I'd want to be paired with on a project more than George. He gets his work done, but also approaches his work with a sort of [craftperson's] spirit that I really appreciate."</p>
