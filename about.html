        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>In the past I've been a few things, including a full-time touring musician, a prop in a Shakespeare play, a National Merit Scholar, and a door-to-door salesperson.</p>
        <p>
        I'm currently working as a product and engineering lead on cross-functional teams at Patreon, helping creators everywhere earn a living. 
        I'm passionate about building diverse teams of talented people who can create exceptional products together safely and sustainably.
