        <h1>Engineering</h1>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h3>Compassionate design</h3>
        <p>
            I encourage engineers I work with to design for radical maintainability. This may mean using an existing pattern versus 
            trying something new, spending an extra 5 minutes to choose the right name for something, or going the extra mile to document an interface. 
            I've learned that a basic design that can be easily recognized and reconfigured is more valuable than an elegant solution that doesn't
            make sense when I'm&nbsp;gone.
        </p>
        <h3>Support and collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            Fear, comparison, and competition are so entrentched <!-- widespread --> in engineering culture that many developers confuse demonstrating <!--(or signaling)--> intelligence with acheivement. 
            The best solutions come about when teams of talented, motivated people feel safe to share what they know and admit what they don't. Pairing and mobbing are powerful tools 
            in the hands of engineers who are not afraid of being exposed, or incentivized to collect personal&nbsp;wins.
        </p>
        <h3>Cross-functional excellence</h3>
        <p>
            While great engineering fundamentals never go out of style, I believe impactful application development should look different in 2019 
            than it did in 2009, or 1999. I advocate for hiring and compensation systems that reward anticipation of users' needs and contribution to 
            the business's mission in addition to technical mastery<!--skill-->. This encourages product and engineering 
            to operate as one team instead of reluctant allies.
        </p>
